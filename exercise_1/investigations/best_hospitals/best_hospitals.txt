These are the top ten hospitals with the highest quality of care. Each hospital is evaluated in two parts. The hospital overall rating in General Hospital Information table is set out of 5 and represents 50% of the weighting. The compared to national ranking (for every procedure that shows Better than national rate 1 point is awarded) is set out of 8 (since the hospital with the highest score in this section is 8) from the Readmission table represents the other 50% of the weighting. In some cases the aggregate score is the same but because the same 1 point is worth more in the first weighting category, there is a difference in weighted average score.
